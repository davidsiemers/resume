    <p>
      I have been a software engineer for nearly a decade. In my time developing
      software, I have worn a lot of hats. From front-end, back-end, DevOps,
      DBA, team lead, project manager and everything in-between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technology wise, I’m proficient in and have worked extensively with:
      Javascript/Typescript and it’s plethora of frameworks/runtimes
      (React, Next.js, Vue, Node), PHP (Laravel, Symfony),
      CSS and CSS Frameworks/Preprocessors (SASS/LESS, Tailwind, CSS Components, Styled Components),
      Markup/Markdown of any variety, Python, E-commerce Platforms (Magento and Shopify),
      Serverless Architecture, and Query Languages (SQL, NoSQL, GraphQL).
      I’m also quite acquainted with tools and workflows such as Git/Mercurial,
      Agile Software Development (SCRUM, Kanban, Jira) and Webpack.
    </p>
    <p>
      While my technical ability is broad, as of late, I have been focusing on
      headless JAMStack applications/websites and the microservices around them.
      Anything static, serverless, and decoupled I'm a total nerd for :).
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have experience leading teams through complex, long projects
      and mentoring (and learning from!) bright junior developers.
