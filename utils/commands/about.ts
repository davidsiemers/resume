        Howdy, I'm David, a full-stack engineer, and welcome to my web resume!
        I figured a terminal-inspired website would be a bit more fun than your
        typical PDF's and LinkedIn profiles brimming with technical jargon
        (though, I have one
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-siemers/" target="_blank">here</a>
        if you're inclined).
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a passion for creating stellar user experiences. Now, I'm sure
        you're asking yourself, "Okay, code-monkey, what does that <i>mean</i>"?
        It's easy to use hollow-language, especially when trying to attract
        potential new employers, but I really stand by that. If someone, and
        I mean anyone--an end-user, a client, a developer, a QA engineer,
        or Steve from accounting--is using software that I had a part in
        creating, I want it to be awesome. It doesn't matter if it's front-end,
        back-end, tooling, testing, or anything in between, I strive for excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a collaborative person by nature and strongly believe that excellent
        products cannot be created by a single person. I advocate for a strong
        team culture and for everyone I work with to be happy, healthy and treated
        well.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy modifying retro video game consoles, tinkering
        with IoT, spending time with my lovely partner, and
        gardening ðŸŒ±.
